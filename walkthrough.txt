Github Cognitive Walkthrough
Four criteria for walkthrough of tasks:


Will users try to achieve right effect?
Will user notice correct action is available?
Will user associate correct action with effect to be achieved?
If correct action is performed, will user see progress is being made to solution?



Task 1: Sign In:
Click sign-in button; username/password; Click sign-in button.  Success
Task 2: Create repository for walkthrough
See "my repositories"; nearby "new repository" button; click button; create a repository form; defaults to me as owner.  Custom name and description; Public/Private (described well).
Initialize repository?  Creates README, but is that all?  It says to skip if importing existing repo.  Means I should check the box.
Gitignore is failure: long menu list of obscure terms.  License is approachable from information button.
Create repository.  Success
Task 3: Load these notes into github repo.  Four options: create file, upload file, find file, clone/download.  The latter 2 seem unreasonable for this task.  I could upload the text file I am working on at the moment.  I will try to create and copy/paste.
Create: opens text editor and prompts for filename.  Entered walkthrough.txt.
Copy and paste this document.

This was surprising because all of the formatting was lost.

This is confusing.  At this point it does not seem possible to format document.  The final option is to commit new file with optional comment.  I know enough about version control this should be a meaningful message to locate this version (much harder to do than say).  But next is a question about committing to master or a new branch.  Not clear what this means.  Failure.
　
I will commit this version of the walkthrough now.  Commit message: "First pass walkthrough from sign in; create repo; create new file; to first commit." Commit to master.

BitBucket Cognitive Walkthrough

Four criteria for walkthrough of tasks:

    Will users try to achieve right effect?
    Will user notice correct action is available?
    Will user associate correct action with effect to be achieved?
    If correct action is performed, will user see progress is being made to solution?

Task 1: Sign Up:

Get Started button; Email/username/password; Verify email; sign-in button. Success
Task 2: Create repository for walkthrough

See “my repositories”; nearby “create a repository” link; click link; create a repository form; Public/Private; Git/Mecurial (not obvious; competitor of GitHub so I choose Git).

Initialize repository? I select “starting from scratch”.  Instructions are to set up Git on my local machine.  Unfortunately, the instructions are for Mac/Unix and I am on a PC.

Create repository. Failure on criterion 2.
Task 3: Load these notes into github repo.

It does not seem to be possible without installing local Git application.

Task 1: Sign In:

Click sign-in button; username/password; Click sign-in button. Success
Task 2: Create repository for walkthrough

I see a blue CREATE button in upper right.  It stands out in great relief but is slightly ambiguous.  However, the rest of the site is cluttered with stuff which doesn’t appear to be for creating a repo.  I click create.

New page with Create Your Project now and lots of detailed information about creating a new project.  Success.

Sourceforge has many options. Git, SVN and Mercurial.  Here Mercurial is explained.  I select all 3.

2-factor authentication.  Need SMS to phone.

Create repository. Success

Note: It may not have been unique if Google Code was still around.  Google Code shut down on January 25, 2016.

USER STUDY
